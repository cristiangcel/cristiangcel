<small>A picture of myself in September 2023 - by Heraclea Foto, All Rights Reserved.</small>
</p>
<p>My name is Gennaro Cristian Celestino, known online as cristiangcel. I am a Psychology student and in my free time, I am interested in current events, activism, and writing.</p>
<p>In my spare time, I manage this little website, which is my personal space on the web, where I write articles on topics of interest to me, present my literary works, and offer my readers other types of content related to what I do or think.</p>
<p>Additionally, I write and publish books independently; in fact, I am also an Italian underground author who offers a small selection of literary works to a limited circle of readers. I do not seek widespread notoriety but prefer that my content be read by those who are truly passionate about &ldquo;niche&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Therefore, I do not aim for broad visibility of my content in any way, even though I use the internet to make my work somewhat more accessible: in our century, the internet offers us vast opportunities for anything.</p>
<p>Speaking of politics, my thoughts are not based on a specific ideology but rather on fundamental human rights and what is closer to progress, as opposed to anything that is repressive and, at the same time, &ldquo;conservative.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I am also very interested in digital rights and free software: I consider copyright to be an instrument that completely hinders the free flow of culture and information.</p>
<p>I want to thank readers for their curiosity about me and my content, and I hope I have provided quality and interesting articles that have sparked your curiosity. I extend my warmest regards.</p>

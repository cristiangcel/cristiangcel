<small>Activists of the UAAR at the 2014 Commemoration of the Capture of Rome - by Sergio D'Afflitto, CC BY-SA 4.0</small>
</p>
<p>In recent years, the topic of baptism and its subsequent religious imposition has sparked an increasingly heated debate in contemporary society. More and more people are choosing to &ldquo;debaptize&rdquo; themselves, a symbolic act of liberation from perceived constraints often dictated by a social and cultural context influenced by religion, particularly Catholicism. This phenomenon reflects the desire to affirm one&rsquo;s autonomy and reject a religious identity imposed from birth.</p>
<p>Many individuals grow up in environments where religion plays a predominant role in personal and social decisions. This pressure can manifest through family expectations and imposed social norms. The choice to de-baptize oneself thus becomes a way to assert the right to be the masters of one&rsquo;s own life and choices, opposing religious ideologies that can limit freedom of thought. Globally, apostasy is considered a punishable crime, further confirming human rights violations by such systems.</p>
<p>Debaptism is also viewed as a form of protest against the injustices perpetuated by religious hierarchies that discriminate and stigmatize diversity, limiting the rights of specific categories, such as women, LGBTQIA+ individuals, and religious minorities. In this context, debaptizing oneself takes on a strong value of self-determination and an opportunity to assert independence from unwanted religious labels.</p>
<p>As for the methods of debaptism, the first step involves downloading the form available on the official website of the Union of Rationalist Atheists and Agnostics (UAAR), filling it out with personal data, and attaching identification documents. The completed form can be sent by registered mail with return receipt, email, fax, or delivered in person to the parish priest. It is essential, in the latter case, to request a signed receipt as proof of delivery. According to Italian law, it is the responsibility of the priest to process the debaptism request.</p>
<p>If one does not know their parish of belonging, it is possible to find information on the portal of the Italian Episcopal Conference (CEI) or contact the UAAR for assistance. Alternatively, one can reach out to the parish where they received communion, confirmation, or where the marriage was celebrated to obtain details regarding baptism.</p>
<p>Parishes are obligated to respond to the debaptism request within 15 days of receiving the letter, sending a written confirmation attesting to the registration of the request in the baptismal register. In case of no response, it is possible to file a complaint with the Guarantor for the Protection of Personal Data, a free procedure that can be undertaken with the assistance of the UAAR.</p>
<p>According to data provided by the UAAR, the number of debaptism requests is steadily increasing, reflecting a growing disaffection towards the Catholic Church and its institutions. This trend indicates a cultural shift in progress, where an ever-increasing number of individuals choose to assert their freedom of thought by distancing themselves from a religious identity that they no longer feel aligned with their beliefs.</p>
<p>Debaptism is not only a personal act but also a clear signal of protest against the Church&rsquo;s positions on ethical and social issues, highlighting the desire to redefine one&rsquo;s beliefs and reclaim personal autonomy. The action promoted by the UAAR not only facilitates this process but also represents a moment of collective reflection on themes of freedom, dignity, and self-determination.</p>
<p>Thus, the phenomenon of debaptism emerges as an important expression of personal liberation and contestation of a religious system perceived as oppressive. More and more individuals, weary of the expectations imposed by tradition and religious culture, decide to embark on this path to reclaim their identity and assert the right to live according to their own convictions. The growing demand for de-baptism is symptomatic of a significant socio-cultural change, where the quest for intellectual and personal autonomy becomes increasingly strong and contributes to a broader dialogue on identity and values in a constantly evolving society.</p>

<p>In an era where information and culture are more accessible than ever, the effectiveness and fairness of copyright is being questioned. The reality is that copyright limits the sharing of knowledge and cultures, causing harm to all of humanity, especially to those living in poorer countries who do not have access to the desired materials. It is time to reflect on how this regulation, originally created to protect the author, is actually crystallizing works and ideas, thus denying many the opportunity to enjoy and contribute to a shared cultural heritage.</p>
<p>If we consider the digital world, the issue becomes even more critical. While a printed book requires physical resources and a tangible production cost, its digital counterpart has virtually no distribution costs. The question then arises: does it still make sense to limit the dissemination of virtual works? Failing to understand the value of free circulation of knowledge is akin to condemning works otherwise destined for oblivion. History is filled with works that, due to a lack of physical copies, have been lost. This situation is not only unjust but undermines the common good and the future of our culture.</p>
<p>Let’s think about authors and artists: what harm could there be in making an unknown film accessible forty years after its production, which would otherwise go unnoticed? The author, unable to earn from works that are not commercially available, does not incur an economic loss; rather, the resurgence of their works could lead to a new life and appreciation in a different cultural context. History has taught us that both valuable works and those we might consider under the radar today could be revived in future eras.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there are alternatives to traditional copyright, such as licenses that allow for non-profit redistribution while still protecting the author and recognizing their authorship. It is crucial that governments stop favoring the interests of large lobbies and begin to serve those of the people. The true role of a state should be to represent and protect the community, not the ambitions of those seeking only profit.</p>
<p>The fight for the right to culture is a battle that we should all support. The European Pirate Parties, while currently a niche reality, aspire to become a force capable of promoting significant changes in this field. It is essential for civil society to mobilize actively to defend the right to share and access culture.</p>
<p>In conclusion, it is time to recognize that the sharing and enjoyment of cultural materials is not theft, but a fundamental necessity. Returning to a vision of culture that is accessible to all is a path we can embark upon, respecting the work of authors and recognizing the collective value of knowledge.</p>

<p>Journalism is a complex and varied field, in which not all professionals operate with the same integrity. There are journalists who simply report official narratives and others who, with courage and determination, dig beneath the surface to uncover hidden truths. The latter can be considered the true heroes of our time, dedicated to exposing propaganda and bringing uncomfortable facts to light.</p>
<p>In a world where information flows rapidly and narratives can be manipulated, the role of a true journalist is to not bow before power and to not tell fairy tales, but to discover and document the objective reality of events. This work can be extremely dangerous; some of the most emblematic figures in the struggle for truth have faced severe reprisals.</p>
<p>In the West, an emblematic example is Julian Assange, founder of WikiLeaks, who made available to the world a series of classified documents, revealing war crimes and abuses of power by the U.S. government and its allies. Assange has been persecuted and forced to live in a sort of exile; his story is a warning about the cost of investigative journalism and the determination of individuals who risk their freedom to ensure that important information reaches the public.</p>
<p>In the East, another example is Anna Politkovskaja, a Russian journalist known for her courageous reporting on the conflicts in Chechnya and her criticism of Putin&rsquo;s regime. Politkovskaja faced repeated threats and was ultimately assassinated in 2006. Her death raised questions about the price journalists must pay to tell the truth and the fact that, in an oppressive regime, the language of truth is too often silenced by violence.</p>
<p>These two cases highlight an uncomfortable truth: a state that claims to be &ldquo;democratic&rdquo; and a global example of freedom silences the work of journalists in order to hide uncomfortable truths about crimes that have occurred and maintains control over information through fear and censorship. Freedom of the press, fundamental to the functioning of a healthy democracy, is often threatened by repressive laws, intimidation, and violence. Journalists who dare to challenge power and question official narratives find themselves facing not only censorship, but also personal reprisals, as in the case of Assange.</p>
<p>The question at the heart of such tragedies is simple: if a state is innocent, it will have no interest in silencing journalists. On the contrary, a state or regime guilty of crimes fears those who can reveal the truth about its actions. It is precisely in the attempt to cloud the truth that many states launch campaigns against journalists and organizations that expose these states&rsquo; crimes.</p>
<p>Today more than ever, it is essential to recognize the value of investigative journalism and to support those reporters who, with integrity and courage, fight against a system that would prefer to see only controlled and neatly packaged news. The truth is a precious asset, and its preservation is a task that concerns us all: a true journalist is one who tells uncomfortable truths, not one who tells fairy tales!</p>

&lt;p&gt;Journalism is a complex and varied field, in which not all professionals operate with the same integrity. There are journalists who simply report official narratives and others who, with courage and determination, dig beneath the surface to uncover hidden truths. The latter can be considered the true heroes of our time, dedicated to exposing propaganda and bringing uncomfortable facts to light.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;small&gt;Activists of the UAAR at the 2014 Commemoration of the Capture of Rome - by Sergio D&#39;Afflitto, CC BY-SA 4.0&lt;/small&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recent years, the topic of baptism and its subsequent religious imposition has sparked an increasingly heated debate in contemporary society. More and more people are choosing to &amp;ldquo;debaptize&amp;rdquo; themselves, a symbolic act of liberation from perceived constraints often dictated by a social and cultural context influenced by religion, particularly Catholicism. This phenomenon reflects the desire to affirm one&amp;rsquo;s autonomy and reject a religious identity imposed from birth.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;small&gt;The Pirate Bay, a famous torrent search engine - by Broblike, CC BY-SA 4.0&lt;/small&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an era where information and culture are more accessible than ever, the effectiveness and fairness of copyright is being questioned. The reality is that copyright limits the sharing of knowledge and cultures, causing harm to all of humanity, especially to those living in poorer countries who do not have access to the desired materials. It is time to reflect on how this regulation, originally created to protect the author, is actually crystallizing works and ideas, thus denying many the opportunity to enjoy and contribute to a shared cultural heritage.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

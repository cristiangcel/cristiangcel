&lt;p&gt;Journalism is a complex and varied field, in which not all professionals operate with the same integrity. There are journalists who simply report official narratives and others who, with courage and determination, dig beneath the surface to uncover hidden truths.

The reality is that copyright limits the sharing of knowledge and cultures, causing harm to all of humanity, especially to those living in poorer countries who do not have access to the desired materials. It is time to reflect on how this regulation, originally created to protect the author, is actually crystallizing works and ideas, thus denying many the opportunity to enjoy and contribute to a shared cultural heritage.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

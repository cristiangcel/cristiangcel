<small>A typical 1920's - 1930's desk - by J. Lim, CC BY-NC-SA 2.0</small>
</p>
<p>My literary works are the result of a deep and genuine passion for writing: to discover these works means to immerse oneself in rich emotional universes, where each piece offers a new perspective, provocative emotions, and, if one can grasp the hidden meaning, a chance for personal growth. Whether it is poetry or narrative, my literary works have the ability to touch the soul of the reader and provide a noteworthy literary experience.</p>
<h3 id="lira-di-due-mondi-2023">L&rsquo;Ira di due mondi (2023)*</h3>
<p>On a restless night, the protagonist grapples with a chilling nightmare: the haunting memory of his beloved&rsquo;s death evokes a wound that has never healed. With a tumultuous heart and a burning warrior spirit, his existence is consumed by an insatiable thirst for revenge that drives him beyond the limits of humanity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;L&rsquo;Ira di due mondi&rdquo; is a work that explores the boundaries between love and perdition, an intense and gripping narrative that immerses us in the depths of the soul of a man marked by pain. With determination and courage, the protagonist undertakes treacherous journeys through malevolent realms, confronting terrible creatures and unimaginable challenges. Every step is guided by a single objective: to avenge the suffering of his people and seek retribution for the painful death of his companion.</p>
<p>A profound narrative about grief, suffering, revenge, and in a certain sense madness, is at the heart of this work.</p>
<p>Book in Italian, fantasy and adventure: <strong>coming soon.</strong></p>

<h3 id="antologia-poetica-dellanno-ventidue-2022">Antologia Poetica dell&rsquo;anno ventidue (2022)</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Antologia Poetica dell&rsquo;anno ventidue&rdquo; is a collection of raw and experimental poems, intended to document the author&rsquo;s artistic past and his evolution in the literary field: they do not represent the current style that characterizes his new works, but they are nonetheless pieces that showcase his creativity and talent at a specific moment in his career.</p>
<p>The author himself has stated that this collection represents an experiment in a writing style and production subsequently abandoned and renounced: the works still hold intrinsic value in their expressive and stylistic originality, even though they have been renounced by the author himself.</p>
<p>A work for those who are curious to read &ldquo;what came before&rdquo; from this young underground author.</p>
